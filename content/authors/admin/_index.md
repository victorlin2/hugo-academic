I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University School of Medicine. My research interests center around analytical chemistry, especially LC-MS and NMR-based omics studies, including, but not limited to, metabolomics, lipidomics, exposomics, and application in biomedical and environmental research, such as metabolism, cancers and chemicals exposure biomarkers.
